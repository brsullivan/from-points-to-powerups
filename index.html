                                Throughout this presentation, I will be making a couple of assumptions about games and the people who play them. By definition, these will always be assumptions because it would be impossible to figure out
                                how each of the more than 7 billion people on the planet feel about games; however, I want to set up some expectations so that you'll understand why I feel comfortable making these assumptions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                First, I believe it's safe to assume games are universal because there are examples of games dating back over 5,000 year and spanning across the millenia. We also know games have been found in various
                                cultures all across the world.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Second, I think it is important to understand that games can look very different, even while employing the same strategies and techniques. Sudoku, Clue and Call of Duty aren't likely to have many common
                                characteristics, but each has a set of rules with specific conditions for success.
                            </p>

                            <p>Finally, because of this wide variety of games and vast history of cultural significanc, I feel confident in assuming everyone enjoys at least one game.</p>

                            <p>Games come in many shapes & sizes:</p>

                            <li>Keep the game elements relevant to the task</li>

                                <li>You'll want to make sure you keep the context of your application in mind when deciding how to gamify.</li>
                                <li>Make sure you really understand your users because relevance to their interests can make or break your efforts.</li>
                                <li>Doesn't mean you can't have fun with it - just keep the context in mind. Quick tasks should have quick stories, save the longer plots for ongoing efforts. *** ADD MORE HERE ***</li>

                                    You can reap the rewards of gamification without developing an over-the-top, fully animated and silly experience. Particularly if you're gamifying in a corporate context, you don't want to make your users
                                    think you don't take their jobs seriously.

                                <li>Gamifying an existing application doesn't mean you can skip the training. While you don't want to change the way a user performs the tasks, you can expect them to immediately understand the rules.</li>
