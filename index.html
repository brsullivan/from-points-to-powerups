                                My name is Braelyn Sullivan. I was with CapTech Consulting for
                                almost four years, but began a new job this week with Duke Energy.

                                At CapTech, I was primarily a front end developer but I also dabbled
                                in some mobile and game development. I'll be trying to keep this
                                presentation pretty broad so everyone can get something out of it,
                                but I've got some developer-specific recommendations I will share at
                                the end.

                                The first thing I think it's important to understand is that games
                                are a universal experience. It would be impossible to know for sure
                                how all 7 billion + people on the planet feel about games, but it's
                                very likely that everyone enjoys a game in some form. It's possible
                                to make this assumption because we have examples of games dating
                                back over 5,000 years and spanning cultures across the world.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Games come in many shapes: video games, board games, card games,
                                brain teasers like crossword puzzles - there's something for
                                everyone and they all share some common ideas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You wouldn't think Candy Land, Sudoku and Call of Duty have anything
                                in common, but each has it's own set of rules with specific
                                conditions for success, enough variability that the game won't be
                                the same every time you play, and opportunities to modify the
                                difficulty to fit the player's preferences.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This assumption is relevant to what we're talking about today
                                because gamification essentially means taking your application and
                                making it more like a game. Some people hear that and immediately
                                think it is going to discourage some users from participating. I
                                don't believe that's true. It all comes down to how you implement
                                it.

                                player experiences a game. This can include, but is not limited to,
                                any of these items.

                                    to a point. One way gamification works is by leveraging
                                    intrinsic rewards like happiness and subjective well-being by
                                    promoting a sense of accomplishment.

                                    When we achieve a goal, these positive feelings reinforce our
                                    positive behaviors - creating motivation to continue.

                                    Another way gamification can help is by creating a distraction
                                    for tedious tasks like manual data entry. If you can make it
                                    entertaining, it won't lead to burnout which can actually
                                    improve overall quality.

                                    A note: The goal of gamification is not addiction. You want to
                                    be really careful about encouraging or rewarding negative
                                    behaviors. This is where user experience design & testing can be
                                    really crucial for success.

                                candidate for gamification are:

                                    Gamification is not a totally new paradigm. No matter your role,
                                    you can apply some of the standards and processes you already
                                    know well to deliver a great gamification product.

                                    You can reap the rewards of gamification without developing an
                                    over-the-top, fully animated and silly experience. Particularly
                                    if you're gamifying in a corporate context, you don't want to
                                    make your users think you don't take their jobs seriously.

                                    Gamifying an existing application doesn't mean you can skip the
                                    training. While you don't want to change the way a user performs
                                    the tasks, you can't expect them to immediately understand the
